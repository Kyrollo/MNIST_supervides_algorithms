# ML Classification Models

This repository contains Python implementations of various machine learning classification models including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree for classification tasks.

## Description

The project demonstrates the implementation and usage of different classification models using the scikit-learn library. Each model is encapsulated in a custom wrapper class for ease of use, and includes methods for training and predicting. Additionally, the repository provides scripts for hyperparameter tuning to find the best model configurations.

## Features

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
  - Trains and predicts using the KNN algorithm.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for the number of neighbors (k).
  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
  - Trains and predicts using the SVM algorithm.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for the regularization parameter (C) and kernel type.

- **Decision Tree**:
  - Trains and predicts using the Decision Tree algorithm.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for max depth and minimum samples split.

## Usage

To use these scripts, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ML-Classification-Models.git
